# vaxmanpython
Implementation of the game "vaxman" in python over hbokmann pacman implementation and you can find it here: https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman

Rules of the game

* Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
* Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
* Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 5 seconds (the infection grows).
* The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.
OBS: the multiply time can be seted at "time_to_multiply" var to increase the challenge.
